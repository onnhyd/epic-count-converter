    <h1><b>Linear Density or Yarn Count</b></h1>
        <section>
            <p>Linear Density is a number that indicates :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mass per unit length (M/L or ML<sup>-1</sup>)</li>
                <li>Length per unit mass (L/M or LM<sup>-1</sup>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are two system of yarn count :</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Direct system &rarr; Mass per unite length </li>
                <li>Indirect system &rarr; Length per unite mass </li>
            </ol>
